# NmapBashScript

This is a simple application of bash script I picked up from reading Linux Basics for Hackers: Getting Started with Networking, Scripting, and Security in Kali written by OccupyTheWeb.

Usage:

1. Add execute permission to the script

```
chmod u+x script.sh
```

2. Execute the script

```
sudo /script.sh
```
